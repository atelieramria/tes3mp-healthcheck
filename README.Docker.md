# TES3MP Healthcheck

TES3MP Healthcheck is a utility for monitoring the status of a TES3MP server.  It uses Discord webhooks to send messages when the server goes down and when it comes back up.

See `.env.sample` for an example of which environment variables need to be populated.

This has been developed with Python 3.11.
